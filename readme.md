#ExtJS6 Playground

This repository is for demo purposes at SenchaCon 2015.
It will contain code demos of our new framework: Ext JS 6.

NOTE: This repository won't contain a copy of Ext6.
As soon as the Ext6 Beta comes out, I will include it,
and migrate the examples so it will work.

NOTE (to myself):
These demo's work with build 6.0.0.181 and Cmd 6.0.0.81.
First generate a workspace, then upgrade all the apps.

Cheers,
Lee Boonstra
